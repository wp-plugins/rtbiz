rtBiz Internal Architecture
===========================

rtBiz has been developed with a motto of developing an application framework -cum- plugin. And hence, it serves its dual purpose pretty well.

rtBiz can become a fully functional application framework for other add-ons. Lot of thought-process and hard work have been pursued to develop such framework from grass root level. And that's the reason rtBiz has been developed to be robust as a framework for other addons.

This particular article talks about how rtBiz has been architectured internally.
