This is the Welcome Screen of the rtBiz. Here you will find a summarized version of your rtBiz environment.

You can find various Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) along with reporting charts in form of dashboard widgets.

Basically, these widgets gives you a generic overview of your rtBiz system and activities happening within.

It will show various chart distribution based on the attributes assigned to the contacts & their terms.

*NOTE:* Ideally, according to current implementation; whenever any attribute is mapped with Contact CPT, a chart report for that particular attribute will be addaed as a dashboard widget in rtBiz Dashboard.
