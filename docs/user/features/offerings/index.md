Offerings
=========

Offerings module is a unique feature in form of a taxonomy to link it with other custom post types that rtBiz offers.

Many a times, we want to link our Custom Post Types with the products in our E-commerce Store such as WooCommerce or Easy Digital Downloads.

This module takes all the existing products from either a WC or EDD store and synchronize them with the terms of this special attribute taxonomy *Offerings*.

So that we can assign these products to any custom post types that are registered with this taxonomy.

- Offerings are the various products and services offered by an organization.
- All the contacts and companies can be assigned the *Offering* that it/they are using.
- A contact and a company can have multiple Offerings assigned to it/them

This special taxonomy *Offerings* stays available globally to all custom post types so that its terms can be shared between them. New terms are not required to create every time you create a new connection.
